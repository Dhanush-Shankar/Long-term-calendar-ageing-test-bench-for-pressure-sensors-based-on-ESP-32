# Long-term-calendar-ageing-test-bench-for-pressure-sensors-based-on-ESP-32

Tasks:
• Design and develop a mechanical test bench for mounting the sensors
• Design an analog signal interface using Wheatstone bridge circuit and multiplexer to measure 10 pressure sensors
• Interface the circuit with an ESP 32 for programmable data acquisition
• Develop and interface a storage module for data storage and readout (long term up to 1 year of continuous recording)
• Requirement: the complete unit is stand alone without the need for a PC interface, and the data acquisition can be wireless or using an SD card
